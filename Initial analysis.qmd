## For discussion: potential outline of non-spatial analyses

Main things to compare among treatments, excluding spatial behaviour after release:

• Times to events (handling, recovery, total time, etc)

• Adverse outcomes -- injuries, death within 30 days

• Body temperature and hyperthermia

• ...

The range of questions we can answer is limited by the lack of standardised measurements, e.g. no mass for manually restrained pigs.

Also, capture method and drugs are confounded

-   91 manual captures with no drugs

-   155 pole syringe captures with zoletil

-   119 dart captures with zoletil and xylazine (59 atipamezole, 31 yohimbine, 29 without reversal?)

**Q1 Do time to event profiles (survival curves) differ among treatments?**

*Expectation 1.1: Pigs subjected to manual restraint had shorter handling and total time than pigs immobilised with pole syringe or dart.*

Handling time \~ capture method (manual, pole, dart)


```{r handling time by capture method, include = F}
# survival formula
surv.ht <- Surv(time = x$handling_min, event = rep(1, nrow(x)))

# KM survival model
ht1 <- survfit(surv.ht ~ capture_method, data=x)
ht1

surv_median(ht1)

```

Handling time was clearly shorter for pigs subjected to manual handling (median handling time = `r surv_median(ht1)[1,2]` mins, n = `r ht1$n[1]`) than for pigs subjected to immobilisation via pole syringe (median handling time = `r surv_median(ht1)[2,2]`  mins, n = `r ht1$n[2]`), which was clearly shorter than pigs immobilised by darting (median handling time = `r surv_median(ht1)[3,2]` mins, n = `r ht1$n[3]`).    


```{r plot handling time by capture method}
ggsurvplot(ht1, data=x, conf.int = T, 
           palette = "jama",
           legend = "bottom", legend.title = "Capture method",
           legend.labs = c("Manual", "Pole syringe", "Dart"),
           ggtheme = theme_survminer(font.caption = c(10, "plain", "black")))  +
  xlab("Handling time (mins)") +
  ylab("Proportion of pigs") +
  labs(caption = "KM curves: handling time for pigs subjected to different capture methods") 

ht1.median <- as.data.frame(surv_median(ht1)) %>%
  mutate(strata = factor(gsub("capture_method=", "", strata), 
                         levels = c("Manual", "Pole syringe", "Darting")))

ggplot(ht1.median) +
  geom_point(aes(x=strata, y = median)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x=strata, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  labs(y = "Median handling time (mins)", x = "Treatment",
       caption = "Median handling time for pigs subjected to different capture methods") +
  theme_classic()

```

Total time \~ capture method  

    

```{r total time, include = F}
# survival formula
surv.tt <- Surv(time = x$total_min, event = rep(1, nrow(x)))

# KM survival model
tt1 <- survfit(surv.tt ~ capture_method, data=x)
tt1

surv_median(tt1)

# Greatest total time
max.recovery <- as.numeric(x$recovery_min[which(x$total_min == max(x$total_min, na.rm = T))])
```

Total time was also shorter for pigs subjected to manual handling (median total time = `r surv_median(tt1)[1,2]` mins, n = `r tt1$n[1]`) than for pigs subjected to pole syringe (median total time = `r surv_median(tt1)[2,2]` mins, n = `r tt1$n[2]`), which was shorter than pigs subjected to darting (median total time = `r surv_median(tt1)[3,2]` mins, n = `r tt1$n[3]`). 

There's a big statistical outlier in the darted pigs due to one pig with a recovery duration of `r max.recovery` minutes.  

```{r plot capture method TT}
ggsurvplot(tt1, data=x, conf.int = T, 
           palette = "jama",
           legend = "bottom", legend.title = "Capture method",
           legend.labs = c("Manual", "Pole syringe", "Dart"),
           ggtheme = theme_survminer(font.caption = c(10, "plain", "black")))  +
  xlab("Total time (mins)") +
  ylab("Proportion of pigs") +
  labs(caption = "KM curves: total time for pigs subjected to different capture methods")

tt1.median <- as.data.frame(surv_median(tt1)) %>%
  mutate(strata = factor(gsub("capture_method=", "", strata), 
                         levels = c("Manual", "Pole syringe", "Darting")))

ggplot(tt1.median) +
  geom_point(aes(x=strata, y = median)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x=strata, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  labs(y = "Median total time (mins)", x = "Treatment",
       caption = "Median total time for pigs subjected to different capture methods") +
  theme_classic()
```

*Expectation 1.2: Pigs subjected to different chemical treatments had different handling and total time.*

Again, there's some confounding here that will have to be woven into the discussion.

Maybe:

Recovery time \~ drug combination (zol, zol xyl, zol xyl + yohimbine, zol xyl + atipamezole?)  

Anyway, looking at total time for now...

Total time \~ drug combination (zol, zol xyl, zol xyl + yohimbine, zol xyl + atipamezole?)  

Only four pigs got zoletil and xylazine with no reversal. Presumably, they were in a hurry to get away and didn't feel the need for reversal. I think we should exclude these because they don't add any useful information, only noise.  

```{r model drug combo tt, include = F}
xd <- x %>% 
  filter(capture_method != "Manual") %>%
  mutate(capture_method = factor(capture_method, levels = c("Pole syringe", "Darting")))

# create categorical variable for drug combination
xd$combo <- NA
xd$combo[which(xd$drug_s == "Zoletil")] <- "Z"
xd$combo[which(xd$drug_s == "Zoletil/Xylazine")] <- "ZX"
xd$combo[which(xd$dose_yohimbine_mg != "")] <- paste0(xd$combo[which(xd$dose_yohimbine_mg != "")], "+Y")
xd$combo[which(xd$dose_atipamezole_mg != "")] <- paste0(xd$combo[which(xd$dose_atipamezole_mg != "")], "+A")
table(xd$combo)

xd <- xd %>%
  filter(xd$combo != "ZX")

# survival formula
surv.tt.drug <- Surv(time = xd$total_min, event = rep(1, nrow(xd)))

# KM survival model
tt.drug1 <- survfit(surv.tt.drug ~ combo, data=xd)
tt.drug1
``` 

I'm not sure if this is a valid or useful comparison (Jordan?), but pigs given only zoletil had shorter total times (median total time = `r surv_median(tt.drug1)[1,2]` mins, n = `r tt.drug1$n[1]`) than pigs given zoletil and xylazine. There was no clear difference among the latter group, though there was a tendency for pigs that were not treated with a reversal drug to have shorter total times (median total time = `r surv_median(tt.drug1)[2,2]` mins, n = `r tt.drug1$n[2]`) than those administered atipamezole (median total time = `r surv_median(tt.drug1)[3,2]` mins, n = `r tt.drug1$n[3]`) or yohimbine (median total time = `r surv_median(tt.drug1)[4,2]` mins, n = `r tt.drug1$n[4]`). 

```{r plot drug combo tt}
ggsurvplot(tt.drug1, data=xd, conf.int = T, 
           palette = "jama",
           legend = "bottom", legend.title = "Drug regime",
           legend.labs = c("Z", "ZX + A", "ZX + Y"),
           ggtheme = theme_survminer(font.caption = c(10, "plain", "black")))  +
  xlab("Time (mins)") +
  ylab("Proportion of pigs") +
  labs(caption = "KM curves: total time for pigs subjected to different chem immob regimes")
  
tt.drug1.median <- as.data.frame(surv_median(tt.drug1)) %>%
  mutate(strata = gsub("combo=", "", strata))

ggplot(tt.drug1.median) +
  geom_point(aes(x=strata, y = median)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(x=strata, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  labs(y = "Median total time (mins)", x = "Treatment",
       caption = "Median total time for pigs subjected to different chem immob regimes") +
  theme_classic()

```

Again, the zoletil only treatment is perfectly confounded with pole syringe administration and all darted pigs received xylazine except for the four in a hurry.  

```{r drug confounding}
xd %>% group_by(combo, capture_method) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```


**Q2 Did the probability of adverse events differ among capture methods?**

We don't seem to have consistent data for scoring or describing injuries, but we could look at differences in probability of death (from causes other than misadventure) within 30 days.

• Pr(death \<31 days after capture) \~ treatment (± body temp or hyperthermia, total time, recovery duration for immobilised pigs)

**Q3 Did Body temperature and hyperthermia risk differ among treatments?**

I suspect this might depend on when the temperature was taken. For manually restrained pigs, it was taken while the pig was being collared, shortly before release. I presume it was taken during collaring for immobilised pigs, in which case it mightn't be an accurate representation of temperature during prolonged recovery when animals might suffer from poor thermoregulation?

*Expectation 3.1: Average body temperature during handling differed among treatments.*

I don't have a strong prior expectation that any treatment will be 'better' than any other with respect to body temperature during handling.

• Body temp \~ treatment + ambient temp

• Pr(body temp \> 40C) \~ treatment + ambient temp
